## The Battle for Solo Terra
# // LL6

Following [VAGABOND_RED]'s declaration of war, you have been acting as an elite strike team in the battle for Solo Terra. With your victory at the St. Tellan's forward base, [VAGABOND_RED] has dramatically increased the attacks against the HUC.

# Goals
- Commander Ordo has identified three hotspot zones that require your intervention. You must deploy to these zones and do battle with the enemy.
    - [SUCCESS] Egregore Cross - A transit hub that is vital to the HUC's logistics. This will be a Holdout mission, defending a small, close-quarters area from an onslaught of enemies, until the regiment stationed there are able to unload the cargo you bring.
    - [SUCCESS] A SecComm-era munitions graveyard - A huge junkyard of salvagable warheads and weaponry, which has recently been discovered by the St. Tellans. This will be a Control mission, where a dash to secure the area will determine which side gains the equipment.
    - [SUCCESS] A small surface settlement - A St. Tellan base, heavily guarded by artillery, suspected to house a stealth bomber that has been fielded by the St. Tellans. This will be a Gauntlet - crash through the defenses to clear a path for the HUC to follow foot.

# Stakes
- This is the battle for Solo Terra - failure means the destruction of the HUC and what remains of the Evergreen colonists.
