With the defeat of [VAGABOND_RED], and the capture of Laguna, the battle for Solo Terra has been won. But the war is not over. [VAGABOND_RED] was taking orders from a figure he referred to as "The Mendicant", aka [MENDICANT_TWO] - the sibling of [BEGGAR_ONE], another child of the original SecComm NHP [OVERLAND/KINGWATCHER]. With Solo Terra secured, the logical next step in stabilizing Hercynia would be to bring the fight across the sea to the Eastern continent, and confront the God-King of St. Tellus at his own doorstep.

# Goals
- The St. Tellan naval fleet has largely been captured after the fall of Laguna. Once UNION has prepared the fleet for sea travel, cross the Lagunan Straight with the might of UNION and the HUC.
- Make your beach landing on Borea Terra at Bella Costa.
- Defeat the Bicameral Alliance's forces in order to secure the Schedule-2 Printer at the Bella Costa Airfield, flushing out [MENDICANT_TWO]'s ability to contest the city.

# Stakes
- Crossing the sea and capturing Bella Costa is vital in order to have any chance of a continued campaign on the Eastern continent of Hercynia against the Bicameral. Without securing a beachhead at Bella Costa and utilizing it's printer, the combined forces of UNION and HUC will be dead in the water for [MENDICANT_TWO]'s army.
