# Mission // #004
## Total War
# // LL8

You have made the journey across the Lagunan Straight, defeated the [EYE_OF_GOD], and captured the coastal city of Bella Costa. You have entered Total War - no longer will you be facing against just the regional forces sent from the homeland. Now you are going against the full might of St. Tellus and [MENDICANT_TWO] himself.

# Goals
- Assist in one of the theaters of war: the Scuttle, or the Middle Sea
- Defeat [MENDICANT_TWO]

# Stakes
- [MENDICANT_TWO]'s demonstration of power at the Lagunan Bay has shown he (along with his fleet of Kiluea Bombers) is, at the very least, a city-level threat. In the best case scenario, failure to defeat him will result in the prolonging of the War, leading to the death of Rangers and UNION marines. In the worst case scenario, he could be an existential threat to the HUC in the same way [BEGGAR_ONE] and his orbital bombardment platform were. Either way, in order to bring stability to Hercynia, he must be dealt with.
