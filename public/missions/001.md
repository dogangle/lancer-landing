# Goals
- Commander Ordo tasked you with investigating the sudden disappearance of a Ranger team dispatched to Hivehome on a standard recovery mission.
- The Rangers had reported strange activity before going dark - you later learned they were KIA.
- The strange activity was discovered to be a group of St. Tellan raiders in the process of extracting unknown cargo from Hivehome.
- The St. Tellan raiders used deadly force without provokation - now that you have defeated the group that remained in Hivehome, recovering the stolen asset and determining their motivations for entering Solo Terra should be your next priorities.
- You have tracked down and recovered the stolen cargo, eliminating the bulk of the 2nd detachment of St. Tellan forces. Your next priority should be determining what the cargo is, and reporting back to Commander Ordo.

# Stakes
- The St. Tellans stole something they were willing to kill over - failure means they keep it.
- This skirmish is indicative of a large foreign detachment in HUC territory - while you are unsure of their motivations, failure to root this out could lead to them growing in power.

# Reserves
- Walt: Redundant Repairs (used), Burst of Witness
- Biqqthiqq: Moon Cheese
