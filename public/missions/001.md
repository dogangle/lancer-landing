# Mission // #001
## A New Dawn
# Goals
- Commander Ordo tasked you with investigating the sudden disappearance of a Ranger team dispatched to Hivehome on a standard recovery mission.
- The Rangers had reported strange activity before going dark - you later learned they were KIA.
- The strange activity was discovered to be a group of St. Tellan raiders in the process of extracting unknown cargo from Hivehome.
- The St. Tellan raiders used deadly force without provokation - now that you have defeated the group that remained in Hivehome, recovering the stolen asset and determining their motivations for entering Solo Terra should be your next priorities.

# Stakes
- The St. Tellans stole something they were willing to kill over - failure means they keep it.
- This skirmish is indicative of a large foreign detachment in HUC territory - while you are unsure of their motivations, failure to root this out could lead to them growing in power.

# Reserves
- Walt: Redundant Repairs (used), Burst of Witness
- Biqqthiqq: Moon Cheese
