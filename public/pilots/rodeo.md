Ernest Bubblebottom is a hardened man of the people who was born and raised in St. Tellus. Since he was born St. Tellus was run by the God-king St. Tellan, and Ernest hates this man more as each day passes. Ernest has never cared for his city, but cares for the people, even though they do not share the same sentiment for him.

As a child Ernest was a big fan of MNMC, Monday Night Mech Combat, with his favorite wrestler being Bon "Jones" Bones. From the moment he first saw MNMC Ernest knew he wanted to join. He trained long and hard for years until one day he received his big break, a call from the head promoter asking him to join. It only took 1 match for Ernest (Rodeo) to win over the hearts of the MNMC fans. He was a reoccuring character from that day forward.

St. Tellus decided that MNMC wasn't cultrually relevant enough to keep around, and the state decided to turn the arena into another church. That is the straw that broke the camel's back. Ernest decided to turn his back on St. Tellus and make his dangerous escape across the sea to the HUC.

Now Ernest has to take matters into his own hands to free the people of St. Tellus. He will be the change he wants to see. He is - Rodeo.
