BONGDEM was born on a brutal and war-torn Diasporan homeworld, where violence and conflict were a part of everyday life. From a young age, BONGDEM showed a natural talent for combat, and was trained in various forms of martial arts and melee combat by their family and community.

As BONGDEM grew older, they realized that the only way to escape the endless cycle of violence on their homeworld was to leave and join the Union. They managed to secure passage off the planet and eventually enlisted in the Union Auxiliary forces, where they quickly rose through the ranks thanks to their impressive combat skills.

BONGDEM's martial arts training and combat experience made them an ideal candidate for a top-secret research division of the Union military that was working on a program to create super soldiers through advanced genetic modification and cybernetic enhancements. Despite the risks involved, BONGDEM agreed to undergo the experimental procedure, driven by their desire to become an even more effective weapon for the Union.

Over the course of several months, BONGDEM was subjected to intense genetic modification and implantation of cutting-edge cybernetic enhancements. The procedure was incredibly painful and dangerous, but BONGDEM persevered, emerging as a near-perfect super soldier with enhanced strength, speed, and endurance.
